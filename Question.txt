Q:What are 3 good practices related to exception handling?
A: 3 Good practices related to exception handling that I learned through research are
1. Create custom exception classes when the time is right for that to make code clearer and easier to read
2. Don't make an exception that sends a general or no message becasue that's not helpful
3. Don't make excpetions that are too generalized on what it can catch becasue that's also not helpful
